# Welcome

Welcome to the unofficial live remote scripts docs. This is an attempt
to document what i have learned while writing my custom user remote script
for Ableton Live. This Documentation is intended to be written by the ableton
live community to make it easier for users to write their own custom remote scripts.

Special thanks to [gabrielyshay](https://github.com/ggyshay) for his article on [how to make a control surface for Ableton](https://gabrielyshay.medium.com/how-to-make-a-control-surface-for-ableton-56360a0e7a2f) 
which truly helped me out on getting started with writing my own custom script and therefore this documentation.
